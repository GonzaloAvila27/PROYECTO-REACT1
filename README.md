##  Berk Beer's E-commerce

My project is in essence a drink's e-commerce. In principle the idea was to create a fully responsive, dynamic and graphically pleasant web App, using REACT, SASS and various other resources, clearly, it only was an idea, so.. you know things happen and one is not strong enough to fight our greatest enemy, the fearful, terrorizing, but strangely pleasant "PAJA" ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¢ 

So, we end up with basic and rushed CSS and a more than disputable code ðŸ’»  nonetheless functional, and with a good base to improve in .
